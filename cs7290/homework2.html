			<h2>Beer Prices at Major League Baseball Games</h2>
			<p> What's more American than some good old fashioned beer and baseball? One of
			my new favorite pasttimes (since turning 21 in July, obviously), has been having
			a few brews and watching the New York Mets torment me with their inability to 
			win a god damn baseball game.  Now, everyone knows that stadiums like to rip
			you off and charge way too much for my Miller Lite, so I wanted to see how bad my
			beloved New York Mets were overcharging me.  I have luckily discovered that the 
			Giants and Red Sox take advantage of their patrons more than the Mets, and we
			were cheaper than our cross-town rivals the Stankees (oops, I mean Yankees) until
			only recently.  Maybe the additional revenue from beer sales will allow us to afford
			a team that can actually win ballgames, and doesn't spend half the season on the IL.
			Anyways, LFGM and we better make the postseason in 2022 if you're going to continue
			to price gouge my alcoholism.</p>
